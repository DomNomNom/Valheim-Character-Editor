This program creates a backup of your character data with each application. If you happen to lose your character or anything related to it, you can go to "C:\Users\\[username]\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\characters" and recover it.

Tested on Valheim 0.146.11 and Windows 10 x64 20H2. Not tested online.

Always use at your own risk. I am not responsible for the lost of any information from your character or any other harm to your copy of Valheim.

Before editing a character, please make sure it is not a new character and that you played with it in any world.

# Usage
  1. If Valheim is running, close it.
  2. Open ValheimCharacterEditor.
  3. Choose your character and the new customization you want to apply.
  4. Apply the customization.
  5. Enjoy.
 
# Known problems
  - If your character appears naked, start the game, logout and then start the game again. This wont likely happen with the new parser.
  - Steam sync seems to be causing problems when you change your character name. Disabling it is recommended.
  - For some reason the game does not likes some customizations and may reset one or more of your skills. This wont likely happen with the new parser.

# Whats coming next
